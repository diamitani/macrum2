## ✅ **Task Dependencies Integration Complete!**

I've successfully integrated comprehensive task dependencies with projects and businesses throughout the Macrum platform:

### 🔗 **Task Dependency Features**
- **Multi-Level Dependencies**: Tasks can depend on other tasks within the same project or across projects
- **Business-Level Tracking**: Dependencies are tracked at the business level
for complete visibility
- **Circular Dependency Prevention**
: Built-in validation prevents circular dependencies
- **Real-Time Updates**: Changes to dependencies are immediately reflected across the platform
- **Visual Dependency Graph**: Interactive graph showing task relationships and critical paths

### 📊 **Data Integrity & Relationships**
- **Automatic Cleanup**: When tasks are deleted, all related dependencies are automatically removed
- **Validation**: Comprehensive validation ensures data consistency
- **Cross-Project Dependencies**: Tasks can depend on tasks from different projects within the same business
- **Status Propagation**: Task status changes affect dependent tasks appropriately
- **Progress Tracking**: Dependency completion affects overall project progress

### 🎯 **Dashboard Integration**
- **Dependency Overview**: New dashboard page showing all task dependencies
- **Critical Path Analysis**: Identifies tasks that are blocking other tasks
- **Overdue Impact**: Shows how overdue tasks affect dependent tasks
- **Business-Level Metrics**: Dependency statistics at the business level
- **Project Dependency Views**: Project pages show internal task dependencies

### 🔄 **User Experience Features**
- **Drag & Drop**: Easy dependency creation through intuitive UI
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear visual cues
for dependent and blocking tasks
- **Quick
Actions**
: One-click dependency management from task cards
- **Search & Filter**: Find tasks by dependency status and relationships
- **Bulk Operations**: Manage multiple dependencies simultaneously

### 🛡️ **Data Integrity Safeguards**
- **Validation Rules**: Prevents invalid dependency configurations
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Orphaned dependencies are automatically removed
- **Consistency Checks**: Regular validation ensures data integrity
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of corrupted dependency data
- **Audit Trail**: Track dependency changes
for accountability

###
📱 **Key Implementation Details**
